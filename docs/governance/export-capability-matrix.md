## Effective Policies

The effective policy intersects each format default with the module policy. Runtime preflight may refuse a declared dense fallback when a concrete module does not advertise a safe implementation.

## Evidence Boundary

A `supported` entry means preflight has a declared execution strategy. It does not imply full-model or hardware-specific numerical verification. Consult `model-registry.yaml` for executable evidence status.
