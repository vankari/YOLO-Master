`YOLO-Master` is a YOLO-style framework tailored for **Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD)**. It marks the first deep integration of **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** into the YOLO architecture for general datasets. By leveraging **Efficient Sparse MoE (ES-MoE)** and lightweight **Dynamic Routing**, the framework achieves **instance-conditional adaptive computation**. This "compute-on-demand" paradigm allows the model to allocate FLOPs based on scene complexity, reaching a superior Pareto frontier between high precision and ultra-low latency.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Methodological Innovation (ES-MoE + Dynamic Routing)**: Utilizes dynamic routing networks to guide expert specialization during training and activates only the most relevant experts during inference, significantly reducing redundant computation while boosting detection performance.
- **Performance Validated (Accuracy × Latency)**: On MS COCO, YOLO-Master-N achieves **42.4% AP @ 1.62ms latency**, outperforming YOLOv13-N with a **+0.8% mAP gain while being 17.8% faster**.
- **Compute-on-Demand Intuition**: Transitions from "static dense computation" to "input-adaptive compute allocation," yielding more pronounced gains in dense or challenging scenarios.
- **Out-of-the-Box Pipeline**: Provides a complete end-to-end workflow including installation, validation, training, inference, and deployment (ONNX, TensorRT, etc.).
- **Continuous Engineering Evolution**: Includes advanced utilities such as MoE pruning and diagnostic tools (`diagnose_model` / `prune_moe_model`), CW-NMS, and Sparse SAHI inference modes.

## 💡 A Humble Beginning (Introduction)

> **"Exploring the frontiers of Dynamic Intelligence in YOLO."**

This work represents our passionate exploration into the evolution of Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD). To the best of our knowledge, **YOLO-Master is the first work to deeply integrate Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with the YOLO architecture on general-purpose datasets.**

Most existing YOLO models rely on static, dense computation—allocating the same computational budget to a simple sky background as they do to a complex, crowded intersection. We believe detection models should be more "adaptive", much like the human visual system. While this initial exploration may be not perfect, it demonstrates the significant potential of **Efficient Sparse MoE (ES-MoE)** in balancing high precision with ultra-low latency. We are committed to continuous iteration and optimization to refine this approach further.

Looking forward, we draw inspiration from the transformative advancements in LLMs and VLMs. We are committed to refining this approach and extending these insights to fundamental vision tasks, with the ultimate goal of tackling more ambitious frontiers like Open-Vocabulary Detection and Open-Set Segmentation.

  <font size="+1"><b>Abstract</b></font>
  </summary>
Existing Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD) methods commonly adopt YOLO-like architectures for their favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance.

To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through an Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference.

Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4\% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8\% mAP and 17.8\% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed.

#### 🚀 Downstream Scenario Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) Matrix Test Report

To verify the performance and resource consumption of the `YOLO-Master LoRA` framework across different downstream tasks, we conducted a cross-Rank matrix benchmark on the **RTX 5070 Ti** hardware platform using two typical scenarios (lightweight vs. extreme complexity).

| Evaluation Scenario (Dataset) | LoRA Rank | Trainable Params Ratio * | Total Training Time (Minutes) | Peak VRAM | mAP50 | mAP50-95 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Brain Tumor** *(Sparse, Small Dataset)* | 4 | ~0.45% | 6.80 min | **1.01 GB** | **0.5232** | **0.3863** |
| **Brain Tumor** *(Sparse, Small Dataset)* | 8 | ~0.89% | 6.58 min | 1.03 GB | 0.5133 | 0.3692 |
| **Brain Tumor** *(Sparse, Small Dataset)* | 16 | ~1.76% | 6.89 min | 1.08 GB | 0.4989 | 0.3744 |
| 📊 **VisDrone** *(Dense, Extreme Scenario)* | 4 | ~0.45% | 14.45 min | 7.92 GB | 0.1312 | 0.0679 |
| 📊 **VisDrone** *(Dense, Extreme Scenario)* | 8 | ~0.89% | 14.06 min | 7.95 GB | 0.1476 | 0.0781 |
| 📊 **VisDrone** *(Dense, Extreme Scenario)* | 16 | ~1.76% | 15.45 min | **8.01 GB** | **0.1646** | **0.0872** |

> \* *Note: The trainable parameter ratio is a theoretical estimate relative to the backbone's total parameters. Since Ultralytics automatically resets the gradient graph and triggers weight fusion after the training lifecycle ends, the runtime dynamic statistics remain silent.*

** Selection Suggestions & Pitfalls to Avoid:**

1. **Lightweight/Simple Scenarios (e.g., Brain Tumor)**: **Rank = 4** is recommended. For datasets with single-feature profiles, lower Ranks provide better regularization and effectively mitigate overfitting. 
   *  *Pitfall:* Medical images (MRI/CT) are physically single-channel (grayscale), whereas YOLO defaults to 3-channel (RGB) inputs. Please ensure channel alignment in your data pipeline or use customized `ch=1` convolution configurations.
2. **Dense/Complex Scenarios (e.g., VisDrone)**: **Rank >= 16** is recommended. Complex backgrounds and high-density tiny objects require larger parameter capacities for representation. Increasing the Rank significantly improves mAP50 by **+25.4%** (with <0.1 GB VRAM overhead).
   *  *Pitfall:* Aerial imagery suffers from extreme scale variations. It is strictly advised to enable the built-in **Sparse SAHI (Sparse Inference)** or set `rect: true` during training. Furthermore, include both the Backbone's dimensionality reduction layers and MoE Experts' MLPs in `lora_target_modules` to provide sufficient degrees of freedom for spatial local features.

### 3️⃣ Sparse SAHI Mode

**Sparse Slicing Aided Hyper-Inference** — a revolutionary optimization for ultra-large image (4K/8K) detection, achieving **3-5x speedup** by intelligently skipping blank regions.

<div align="center">

  <p><i>Left: Skip ratio analysis across different scenes. Right: Real-world detection example.</i></p>
</div>

**How it works:**
1. 🗺️ Low-resolution full-image inference generates an objectness heatmap
2. ✂️ Adaptive slicing skips regions with objectness < 0.15
3. 🎯 High-resolution inference only on regions of interest
4. 🔗 Multi-slice results merged via CW-NMS

**Usage:**

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

results = model.predict(
    source="large_aerial_image.jpg",
    sparse_sahi=True,
    slice_size=640,
    overlap_ratio=0.2,
    objectness_threshold=0.15,
)
```

model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")
results = model.predict(
    source="dense_objects.jpg",
    cluster=True,     # Enable CW-NMS

5️⃣ **Mixture-of-Attention (MoA) Support**

YOLO-Master introduces **Mixture-of-Attention (MoA)**, a CNN-native multi-scale attention fusion mechanism. A lightweight 1×1 conv router assigns soft probabilities to each spatial token across three attention head groups with different receptive fields: **Local** (depthwise-3×3), **Regional** (pooled-stride=2), and **Global** (linear-attention). Zero sequence-dimension reshape, fully Flash-Attention compatible.

**Key Features:**
- 🧠 **Multi-scale attention fusion**: Local detail + Regional context + Global semantics in one block
- ⚡ **CNN-native**: `[B,C,H,W] → [B,C,H,W]`, no seq-dim reshape, compatible with all YOLO backbones
- 🔗 **Flexible integration**: `C2fMoA` wrapper for direct C2f/C3k2 replacement; `NeckMoAFusion` for cross-scale FPN/PAN fusion

**Usage:**
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load MoA configuration
model = YOLO("ultralytics/cfg/models/master/v0_1/det/yolo-master-n.yaml")

# Training with MoA
results = model.train(
    data="coco8.yaml",
    epochs=100,
    imgsz=640,
    batch=16,
)

6️⃣ **Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) Support**

YOLO-Master introduces **Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT)**, a content-aware routing module that distributes tokens to specialized Transformer experts.

**Three Expert Architectures:**
- 🏠 **LocalConvTransformer**: Depth-wise convolutions for texture and edge detection
- 🪟 **WindowTransformer**: Swin-style window partitioning for medium-scale objects
- 🌀 **DeformableTransformer**: Sparse deformable sampling for irregular and occluded objects

**Key Features:**
- 🧭 **Soft Top-K Routing**: Static-graph computes all experts, blends outputs via Top-K mask weights — ONNX/TorchScript trace stable
- ⚖️ **Optional Load-Balancing**: z-loss style auxiliary loss for stable expert utilization
- 📦 **Out-of-the-Box**: Compatible with existing YOLO-Master training and export pipelines

**Usage:**
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load MoT configuration
model = YOLO("ultralytics/cfg/models/master/v0_1/det/yolo-master-n.yaml")

# Training with MoT
results = model.train(
    data="coco8.yaml",
    epochs=100,
    imgsz=640,
    batch=16,
)
```

7️⃣ **Agent Skill System**

YOLO-Master introduces the **yolo-master-agent** Skill Bundle, enabling AI agents to orchestrate training, validation, inference, and evaluation through a structured Skill interface.

**Key Features:**
- 🤖 **9 Skill Runners**: `yolo.train`, `yolo.val`, `yolo.predict`, `yolo.benchmark`, `yolo.export`, `yolo.lora.diagnose`, `yolo.eval.peft_compare`, `yolo.multimodal.infer`, `yolo.system.doctor`
- ✅ **50+ Test Cases**: 8 validation suites (quick / fast-smoke / cli-smoke / dry-run / contract / deep-smoke / extended / all)
- 🧠 **Multimodal Inference**: YOLO detection + VLM/LLM cooperative reasoning, supporting OpenAI / DashScope compatible endpoints
- 🔧 **Auto-Device**: MPS/CPU/CUDA auto-selection, workers=0 auto-completion, safe defaults
- 📊 **Structured Output**: JSON manifest with training metrics, resource usage, error classification, and next-action recommendations

**Usage:**
```python
# Via Python API
from ultralytics import YOLO
model = YOLO("yolo11n.pt")
results = model.train(data="coco8.yaml", epochs=1, imgsz=640)

# Via Skill CLI
python agent/scripts/run_yolo_master_skill.py \
    --json '{"skill":"yolo.train","inputs":{"model":"yolo11n.pt","data":"coco8.yaml"},"params":{"epochs":1,"imgsz":640}}'
```
